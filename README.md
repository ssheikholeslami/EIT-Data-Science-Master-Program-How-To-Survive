# How to Survive EIT Data Science First Year in TU/e

## First Things First

Welcome to a survival guide for the first year students of EIT Data Science at TU/e.
Congratulations on entering the EIT Digital Master School program. You are in for one hell of a ride filled with lasting friendships, deadlines, networking, good memories, travelling, **the almighty Business Model Canvas** (so much that you will probably hate it by the end of the 2nd quarter), and of course, studying and working hard.

TU/e is one of the best universities in Europe and the world. Being an EIT Digital student, in addition to all the perks you'll get from TU/e, you will also have a lot of resources exclusively available to EIT students. 

Obviously, it's up to you to leverage these opportunities in the best way possible. That being said, it's always a good idea to learn from the experiences of others. One immediate advantage is that you (hopefully) will avoid making their same old mistakes. This has been the main motivation for writing this guide.

I did my first year in TU/e in the academic year of 2017-2018, and now I'm in KTH (Stockholm) for my second year. We were a group of almost 30 first year EIT students, enrolled in Data Science or Embedded Systems programs. Of course we had access to previous years students and we asked them a lot of questions, but still there were many things that we had to learn by ourselves. But when I look back at the year that passed, I see a lot of mistakes that I could have easily avoided making. But we will get to that shortly.

It is obvious that the things presented in this guide are solely my opinions about my last year in Eindhoven; but I think by reading this you will at least avoid making our common mistakes, and hopefully can enjoy your stay in Eindhoven a lot more. But for the sake of formalities (I know), I should explicitly state that
>*... the writer of this guide takes no responsibility in any harm, damage, successful results, nervous breakdowns, tragedies, mistakes, whatever, etc. that might happen to you by following these suggestions.*

Alright? Then let's see how this works.
## Updates, Questions, and Discussions

I will regularly update this guide. Actually I had planned to write this way sooner (like in July) but sometimes I'm a bit lazy when it comes to stuff that do not have a deadline. However, as your first quarter has already started, there's no more time to waste.

If you have any questions, if you find something ambigious,  or want to know about things that are not discussed here but are of interest to you, or if I'm being clearly wrong, then you can open a GitHub Issue and we can discuss more. I will try not to be lazy about this.

Of course, with each commit I will also mention what has been changed, but I'll also try to have some sort of a changelog at the very end of this document. From time to time I might also patch the whole thing as a release to make life easier for all of us.

We will start by some general stuff that you need to know about EIT Digital Master School.

## A Crash Course on EIT Digital Master School 

I should begin with the most important thing: **Do Not Bet Your Life on the Stuff You See On EIT's Data Science Program Webpage**. Always follow the guidelines explicitly given to you by the EIT coordinator at your university - in this case, [this is your holy grail](https://assets.studiegids.tue.nl/fileadmin/content/Faculteit_WenI/Graduate_School/Masteropleidingen/gp2018.pdf) - page 78 onwards.
